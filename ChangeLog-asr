	* asr.c: tweak options

2012-09-09 14:46  eric

	* asr.c: allow to disable some features at build time

2012-09-09 14:15  eric

	* asr.c, asr_debug.c, asr_private.h, res_send_async.c: cleanup
	  asr_debug.c

2012-09-09 11:42  eric

	* asr.c, asr_debug.c, asr_private.h, res_search_async.c,
	  res_send_async.c: use proper macros for debug traces.

2012-09-08 13:08  eric

	* Makefile.inc, asr_resolver.c, getaddrinfo.c, gethostnamadr.c,
	  getnameinfo.c, getnetnamadr.c, getrrsetbyname.c, res_debug.c,
	  res_init.c, res_mkquery.c, res_query.c, res_send.c, sethostent.c:
	  split asr_resolver.c into different files to overlay the libc/net
	  resolver implementation.

2012-09-07 15:49  eric

	* asr.c: return value has no use; make it void.  fix comment.

2012-09-07 15:21  eric

	* getnetnamadr_async.c: unused variables

2012-09-06 21:59  eric

	* asr.c: config parsing is done in one pass now. no need to use
	  callback anymore.

2012-09-06 17:05  eric

	* getaddrinfo_async.c, gethostnamadr_async.c: include yp headers if
	  necessary.  remove unused variable.

2012-09-06 15:57  eric

	* asr_private.h: make it easy to build without debug code

2012-09-06 13:26  eric

	* asr.c: add a strsplit() helper to factorize code a bit.

2012-09-06 10:38  eric

	* async_resolver.3: YP is now supported.

2012-09-06 10:36  eric

	* asr.h, async_resolver.3: remove unused member, reorganize a bit
	  and sync manpage.

2012-09-05 23:49  eric

	* Makefile.inc, asr.c, asr_debug.c, asr_private.h,
	  getaddrinfo_async.c, hostaddr_async.c: Get rid of the
	  hostaddr_async subquery and merge its behaviour directly into
	  getaddrinfo_async_run.  Simplifies everything by a great deal.

2012-09-05 18:52  eric

	* hostaddr_async.c: Implement basic (blocking) YP support for
	  getaddrinfo_async().	YP is now supported on all relevant
	  resolver functions.

2012-09-05 17:56  eric

	* asr.c, asr_debug.c, asr_private.h, getaddrinfo_async.c,
	  hostaddr_async.c: Make hostaddr_async() return a linked list of
	  struct addrinfo.  First round of a getaddrinfo_async()
	  simplification. The goal is to make YP support easier to add, and
	  eventually remove the whole hostaddr_async subquery.

2012-09-04 18:03  eric

	* gethostnamadr_async.c: implement basic YP support for
	  gethostbyname_async()/gethostbyaddr_async() by using the blocking
	  YP API internally.

2012-08-19 19:59  eric

	* asr_resolver.c: Build static netent and hostent structure in a
	  nicer and hopefully not broken way.  Make it almost trivial to
	  implement gethostby*_r() family of functions when needed.

2012-08-19 18:17  eric

	* asr.h, asr_resolver.c, async_resolver.3, gethostnamadr_async.c,
	  getnameinfo_async.c, getnetnamadr_async.c: When building dynamic
	  hostent and netent, allocate a single linear buffer to hold both
	  the structure and the data. The freehostent() and freenetent()
	  API functions are not needed anymore.  While there, ensure that
	  the constructed addr and alias lists are really NULL terminated.

2012-08-18 18:48  eric

	* asr.c, asr_resolver.c, async_resolver.3: ensure that async_run()
	  and async_run_sync() always preserve errno.

2012-08-18 15:49  eric

	* asr_resolver.c, getrrsetbyname_async.c: getrrsetyname() only uses
	  ERRSET_* and is not supposed to set errno.  make sure to save and
	  restore errno properly.

2012-08-18 15:31  eric

	* hostaddr_async.c: Simplify error reporting in hostaddr_async().
	  Only use EAI_* error codes.

2012-08-18 13:19  eric

	* asr_resolver.c, getaddrinfo_async.c, getnameinfo_async.c: Improve
	  error reporting in getnameinfo_async() and getaddrinfo_async().
	  They do not have to deal with h_errno at all.  Also, errno is
	  only kept for EAI_SYSTEM.  Small code cleanup while there.

	  Adapt getnameinfo() and getaddrinfo() wrappers to correctly save
	  errno and overwrite it in the EAI_SYSTEM case.

	  General errno handling issue reported by mikeb@.

2012-07-29 22:33  eric

	* asr_resolver.c: must be zero'd (found by regress)

2012-07-13 16:05  eric

	* getaddrinfo_async.c: properly report EAI_SERVICE when the given
	  servname is not defined for the given protocol.

2012-07-12 15:03  eric

	* gethostnamadr_async.c: unused variables

2012-07-11 18:49  eric

	* asr_resolver.c: implement res_mkquery

2012-07-10 19:30  eric

	* getnetnamadr_async.c: same code update and fix as for
	  gethostnamadr_async

2012-07-10 17:58  eric

	* gethostnamadr_async.c: simplify the code, improve error handling
	  and plug a potential fd leak on error

2012-07-10 14:41  eric

	* gethostnamadr_async.c: use the value actually passed to the
	  function

2012-07-10 11:20  eric

	* getaddrinfo_async.c: Better handling of servname in
	  getaddrinfo_async. Do not necessarily fail if there is no entry
	  for a given protocol. Fix issue reported by early testers.

2012-07-08 19:01  eric

	* asr_resolver.c: implement res_querydomain() required by sendmail

2012-07-08 15:12  eric

	* asr_resolver.c: add stub function for gethostent(), and move
	  things around a bit while here.

2012-07-07 22:41  eric

	* asr_debug.c, asr_private.h, res_send_async.c: rename function to
	  avoid symbol clash

2012-07-07 17:40  eric

	* Makefile.inc: remove bogus include of bsd.lib.mk

2012-04-25 22:28  eric

	* asr_debug.c, getaddrinfo_async.c, gethostnamadr_async.c,
	  getnameinfo_async.c: fix a few warnings

2012-04-16 00:25  eric

	* asr.c: Create a new resolver for each thread.  It will be done
	  differently eventually, but it's enough for now to make the
	  blocking API fully thread-safe without locking.

2012-04-15 23:42  eric

	* asr_debug.c: calling getnameinfo here is a bad idea. use
	  inet_ntop.

2012-04-15 17:08  jmc

	* async_resolver.3: tweak previous;

2012-04-14 14:06  eric

	* Makefile.inc, asr.c, asr_private.h: only define DEBUG internally

2012-04-14 11:24  eric

	* Makefile.inc, asr.c, asr.h, asr_debug.c, asr_private.h,
	  asr_resolver.c, asr_utils.c, async_resolver.3,
	  getaddrinfo_async.c, gethostnamadr_async.c, getnameinfo_async.c,
	  getnetnamadr_async.c, getrrsetbyname_async.c, hostaddr_async.c,
	  res_search_async.c, res_send_async.c: Import asr, an experimental
	  async resolver implementation.  The idea is to eventually replace
	  the existing resolver with something better. Time to start
	  working on it in tree.
