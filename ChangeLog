	* openbsd-compat:
	- import/update from portable OpenSSH:
	  - fmt_scaled.c
	  - mktemp.c (updated from OpenBSD upstream)
	  - setproctitle.c
	  - vis.c
	- limit PATH_MAX and MAXPATHLEN to 1024

	* src:
	- update to latest OpenSMTPD

	I managed to send a mail with Portable OpenSMTPD, but there's
	still some bugs to fix!
